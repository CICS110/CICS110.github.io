This course is designed to provide you with a solid foundation in the basics of programming, regardless of a specific programming language, although we use Python to demonstrate concepts and techniques. This course will cover the key concepts and elements of programming that you need to know to get started in the field of computing. 5 Key Concepts of Programming: Overview of the fundamental concepts of computer programming, including syntax, variables, data types, and control structures.Explanation of the problem-solving process in programming, including the use of algorithms and implementation of solutions.Discussion of the importance of debugging, testing, and code quality in software development.Overview of the software development life cycle, including design, coding, testing, and maintenance.Explanation of how programming concepts and skills can be applied to a variety of real-world scenarios, regardless of the programming language used. Programming is all about using a set of instructions to tell a computer what to do. The basic building blocks of programming include syntax, variables, data types, and control structures. Syntax refers to the specific set of rules for writing code in a particular programming language. Variables are used to store and manipulate data in your programs. Data types determine the type of data that can be stored in a variable, such as numbers, text, or Boolean values. Control structures are used to control the flow of a program and include constructs such as loops, if statements, and switch statements. Programming is not just about writing code, it's also about solving problems. In order to write effective code, you need to be able to identify a problem and then create a solution for it. This solution is often implemented as an algorithm, which is a step-by-step set of instructions for solving a problem. You will use algorithms in your code to control the flow of a program and make decisions based on the data you are processing. As you begin to write more complex programs, you will encounter bugs and errors. Debugging is the process of identifying and fixing these bugs to ensure your code is working as intended. Testing is an essential part of the software development process and involves checking your code for both correctness and performance. Code quality refers to the overall readability, maintainability, and efficiency of your code. It is important to strive for high-quality code, as this makes it easier to debug and maintain your programs over time. The software development life cycle is the process of creating and maintaining software applications. It includes the following phases: design, coding, testing, and maintenance. The design phase involves creating a plan for what your application should do and how it should work. The coding phase involves writing the code for your application. The testing phase involves verifying that your code works as intended. The maintenance phase involves fixing bugs, adding new features, and keeping your application up to date. Programming skills are in high demand and can be applied to a wide range of real-world scenarios, including website development, data analysis, automation, and more. By understanding the basic concepts of programming, you will have the skills and knowledge you need to develop software applications and solve problems in any number of fields. Whether you are interested in creating mobile apps, building websites, or automating tasks, programming is a valuable and versatile skill that can open doors to many exciting career opportunities. note The course material, including all assignments and labs, is openly available from the start of the course. Our goal is to be transparent and open about the material in the course, giving you the opportunity to plan ahead and make the most of your time. This open access allows you to see what is coming up in future lectures, readings, assignments, and labs, so you can stay organized and focused. By providing you with this level of visibility, we aim to make the course as accessible and user-friendly as possible. This approach is in line with our commitment to creating a supportive and inclusive learning environment that empowers you to achieve your goals as a programmer.","keywords":""},{"title":"Assignments","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/main/assignments","content":"Assignments Welcome to the homework assignments section of the course website!

This usually occurs because We're referencing a variable that doesn't exist yetWe're referencing a variable that does exist, but we misspelled a reference somewhere Remember that python runs line by line, top to bottom (once we start writing our own functions this isn't strictly true), so a variable has to be declared above where you first attempt to use it. In rare cases, a variable can get deleted or &quot;garbage collected&quot; before it is called, and this error can occur, but this is extremely rare in Python specifically. This case is more common in almost any other language, like C or Java, where variables declared inside a loop are deleted/garbage collected once the loop finishes. For example for i in range(3): print(i) print(i)  will print 0\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n. In C, the equivalent code for (int i; i &lt; 3; i++) { printf(&quot;%d\\n&quot;, i); } printf(&quot;%d\\n&quot;, i);  will not even compile, because i is deleted, or &quot;garbage collected&quot;, after the loop finished.

Therefore attempting to access index 4 will result in an IndexError: &gt;&gt;&gt; 'test'[4] Traceback (most recent call last): File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt; IndexError: string index out of range  "},{"title":"EOFError​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Common Errors","url":"/main/guides/common-errors#eoferror","content":"EOF stands for &quot;end of file&quot;.

This can happen if you write a loop with no content in it (more recent python versions return an IndentationError, but zyBooks will often return EOFError. If you'd like to know why, make a Piazza post asking about it :D)Your Python tries to read more input than it is given. For example, say your python code checks the first 5 lines of a file.

Psuedocode and control-flow diagrams are both very useful in outlining your full algorithm. In either case, if you're still stuck, see the Asking for Help section above. Another reason you can get stuck in the middle of a section is that you have come up with a solution, but are stuck on how to write an efficient or &quot;clean&quot; solution. Our suggestion here is that you either Finish your current implementation, and then go back and tidy up specific sections.Restart entirely. Run through your algorithm top to bottom before you start to code anything, and look for things you can fix.  The first suggestion often works better if your algorithm is solid, but you weren't quite sure the best way to implement one part of the algorithm. The second suggestion is better for cleaning up an inefficient algorithm. tip This is not something that goes away! Even as advanced programmers, we will get halfway through coding a section, and think Well, I know how I can finish this function, but it's going to end up really messy.

The linter reads through our code, looking for syntax or style issues. How to fix a problem detected by the linter will obviously depend on the problem, but the linter broadly categorizes problems. VSCode will display issues detected by the linter by drawing a squiggly line under the problematic code segment. The color of the squiggly line will change depending on what type of problem was detected: A red underline signifies an error. The linter will produce an error if thinks there is a bug in your code. A green underline signifies a warning. Warnings mostly appear under functions names we have misspelled, under variables we declare and never use, or under variables we attempt to use before they are declared.A blue underline signifies information. In python, this usually means the code segment will run fine, but is bad practice, or is &quot;old&quot; python. In any case, if you hover over the underlined code, the error, warning, or information message will appear, often times indicating what you need to fix:  info What your linter considers an error, warning, or information will depend on what linter you install.

For example, say we have the following code: example.py text = input(&quot;What would you like to type?\\n&quot;) third_character = text[2] print(third_character)  First, we get some input string, and store it in text. Then, we get the character at index 2 of text (the third character), and store it in third_character. Finally, we print third_character out. As written, this code will result in zero messages from the linter. However, this doesn't mean nothing can go wrong. What if I just say Hi? There's only two characters, so happens when we try to access the third character? In Python, we will get the following message back: Traceback (most recent call last): File &quot;/path/to/example.py&quot;, line 2, in &lt;module&gt; third_character = text[2] ~~~~^^^ IndexError: string index out of range  This is an error message. This is essentially Python's way of saying, &quot;Something unexpected just happened, here's the problem we identified and what we were doing when it happened.&quot; More specifically this is what's called a traceback: Python has &quot;traced back&quot; it's steps to figure out: What happened?Where are we? What file are we in, and on what line? Are we in a function call?What steps did we take to get here? Did we make multiple nested function calls? If so, what function calls did we make? The first line of the error message should always read Traceback (most recent call last):  This line identifies an error occurred, and tells us that, if the error lists multiple function calls, the most recent function call is listed last (in other words, the problem happened in the last line listed). Next we have a series of code snippets of the form  File &quot;/path/to/example.py&quot;, line 2, in &lt;module&gt; third_character = text[2] ~~~~^^^  Each of these snippets lists The snippet itself, in this case third_character = text[2]Where the code lives, File &quot;/path/to/example.py&quot;, and on what line, line 2If the snippet is in a function, denoted as in function_name, or not in a function, denoted as in &lt;module&gt;. Code not written in a function is sometimes called &quot;top-level&quot; code. In this instance, the error message also tells us that the error is specifically in the attempt to access text[2], and not in the assignment of text[2] to third_character. In this case, we'd say that &quot;line 2 throws an error&quot;, or &quot;accessing text[2] throws an error.&quot; Finally, the error message will list the name of the specific error that occurred. In this case, we have IndexError: string index out of range  which indicates that we're attempted to access the element of text at an index that doesn't exist.

For example, if we make a function call, and then the error occurs inside the function call, like in: print-name.py def print_name(name): print('My name is ' + my_name) print_name('John')  Python will print out the location of each nested function call made, then the location of the code snippet where the problem happened. In this instance we get the following error message: Traceback (most recent call last): File &quot;/path/to/print-name.py&quot;, line 4, in &lt;module&gt; print_name('John') File &quot;/path/to/print-name.py&quot;, line 2, in print_name print('My name is ' + my_name) ^^^^^^^ NameError: name 'my_name' is not defined  There are two snippets: first the function call print_name('John'), which is listed as in &lt;module&gt; since it's &quot;top-level&quot; code, and then inside the function call we have print('My name is ' + my_name), which is in a call to the print_name function, so it is listed as in print_name. This gives us a sense of what the function call stack looked like at the time of the error, since each successive snippet is a nested function call, with the last line being where the error occurred. "},{"title":"Conditional Errors​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Getting Unstuck","url":"/main/guides/getting-unstuck#conditional-errors","content":"It's possible that you sometimes get an error when you run your program, but not always. In our first example, giving an input of 3 characters or more will not cause an error, because there would be a third character to access. However, sometimes our program will return an error, like when we input Hi. If you only get an error sometimes, but not always, you should figure out Is the error always in the same place?Is it always the same error message?Is the code snippet using some sort of user input? Probably the most common error to get sometimes, but not always, is an IndexError, especially if you're accessing an index of user input. Say we're assuming that a user is going to give us a four digit binary number, and we want to check if the one's digit is less than 6. A bad way to check this would be number = input(&quot;What 4-digit number would you like to check?\\n&quot;) digit = int(number[3]) print(digit &lt; 6)  Why is this bad? Well, what happens if the user gives us a three digit number? number[3] will throw an IndexError. If you don't always get the same error, or the error isn't always in the same place, you likely have multiple errors. It's possible that one of them always happens, and the other only happens sometimes, but happens before we get to the error that is always there.

For example, your program runs successfully, but prints the wrong thing. This is where we largely get into the realm of debugging. Getting rid of error messages is also debugging, but it can be much easier to guess what might be going wrong from an error message than it is from an incorrect, but error-free output. There are four main ways of debugging: Rereading your source code and looking for bugsPutting print statements in various places to check values of variables or what parts of your code are/aren't being executedUsing the debuggerWriting unit tests "},{"title":"Manual Debugging​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Getting Unstuck","url":"/main/guides/getting-unstuck#manual-debugging","content":"Rereading your source code is probably the easiest way to find small errors, so it's highly recommended in the beginning when your code is short. The main downside of this is that, if you've been coding for 2+ hours straight, it's often hard to look for errors in the code you've been staring. If you've ever written a paper and come back the next day to find lots of grammatical or spelling errors, this is the same idea. It can get hard to spot errors in code you've spent a lot of time looking at. tip Take a break before you start debugging. Seriously. If you've been coding for a couple hours straight, implementing your algorithm and getting rid of error messages, the best thing to do is take a quick, 30 minute break and come back to it, especially if you're under a time crunch. "},{"title":"Print Debugging​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Getting Unstuck","url":"/main/guides/getting-unstuck#print-debugging","content":"Print debugging, sometimes referred to as &quot;caveman debugging&quot;, is the most brute force approach. It consists of just putting print statements in various parts of your code to check both what parts are/aren't running and values of variables. Print debugging is effective for small projects where you have a good idea of what is going wrong, or finding what region of your code has the problem. However, if you don't quickly find what is wrong, have a multi-file project where many things could be going wrong, or have multiple underlying problems all at one, print debugging can take a lot of time. You might spend hours changing values of print statements, commenting prints out or back in, and running your code over and over again after each change. "},{"title":"The Debugger​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Getting Unstuck","url":"/main/guides/getting-unstuck#the-debugger","content":"As the name suggests, the debugger is the most powerful tool for finding bugs in your code. Like how the Python interpreter runs your code line by line, the debugger lets you step through your code's execution line-by-line. As your code runs, the debugger will show you What local variables are declared and their valuesThe state of the function call stackTerminal output as it happens The debugger lets you put break points at specific lines in your code, letting you run the program up to a certain point, and then pausing execution, giving you a snapshot in time of how your program is running. You can also set conditional breakpoints, like &quot;stop at this line only if i is 3&quot;. For this reason, the debugger is essentially a strictly stronger version of print debugging. For a tutorial on how to use the debugger in VSCode, see the debugger guide. "},{"title":"Print Debugging vs the Debugger​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Getting Unstuck","url":"/main/guides/getting-unstuck#print-debugging-vs-the-debugger","content":"When it comes to choosing between print debugging vs using the debugger, print debugging is useful if you have a good hunch about what is wrong, and just need verification where things are going wrong. For computer science and informatics students planning on taking more programming languages in the future, we highly suggest you learn to use the debugger now. In less &quot;user-friendly&quot; languages like C, debuggers are objectively more powerful than print debugging for things like picking up segmentation faults. (Aside: these are like Python errors, but instead of immediately giving you the error message and where it happens, C dumps a record of your computer's recorded working memory and says &quot;here's what went wrong!&quot;, which is a lot less fun to read. A debugger will just stop where the segfault happened, and show you what all the variables were, without you having to read through the core dump). We as programmers still use print debugging all the time. But knowing how to use a debugger is an important skill, so we recommend you learn as early as possible, especially while we're working with a &quot;user-friendly&quot; language like Python. "},{"title":"Unit Tests​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Getting Unstuck","url":"/main/guides/getting-unstuck#unit-tests","content":"Say you're writing a calculator app, and you've implemented the following underlying math functions: def add(a, b): ... def subtract(a, b): ... def multiply(a, b): ... def divide(a, b): ... def exponential(a, b): ...  You press all the buttons on your calculator, and expect it to evaluate subtract(add(3, multiply(4, 5)), divide(exponential(10, 2), 2)) and out the result of (3 + 4 * 5) - (10^2)/2 = -27. However, you're calculator gives you a result of -2. How do we know where the problem is? Is it with your calculator buttons? Do the buttons work, but the calculator has an order of operations problem? Is there a problem with one of our math functions? What we can do is we can write a set of tests for each separate function, where we pass it two inputs, and check the output is what we expect. For example, we could call add(2, 3), and then check that it returns 5. We call these tests unit tests, they're a series of tests that make sure the building blocks of our program work in isolation. The idea is that, if we know each of our functions work in isolation, then the problem is in how we call them, or in our algorithm. In Python, we often use assert for unit testing. An example of a set of unit tests for the above code would be assert add(2, 3) == 5 assert add(9, 0) == 9 assert subtract(5, 2) == 3 assert subtract(2, 9) == -7 assert multiply(5, 2) == 10 assert multiply(3, 0) == 0 assert divide(9, 1) == 9.0 assert divide(10, 2) == 5.0 assert exponential(4, 2) == 16 assert exponential(2, 5) == 32  You want your unit tests to cover all inputs. For example, here we'd want to check that our functions all work how we'd expect with positive numbers, negative numbers, floats, and any special cases like 0 for divide and exponential. Unit tests often work best in tandem with another debugging technique. For example, if all of these pass, we can assume that our math functions work, and that our problem is actually that we're using our functions improperly. So we boot up the debugger, and pin down that the problem is in the order of operations conversion section (the example I gave does (10/2)^2, not (10^2)/2). Unit test are often the bulk of your grade on programming assignments. We check that all of your functions work how we ask them to, and then once we know all your functions are working test that your project works as a whole after that.

It might be good for a lab, but I might just shove it in in lecture 3 or 4 f-strings Another good thing for an introductory lab or assignment. Students didn't really use this (and usually forgot about it) so I think it would be good to have them use it in a lab or assignment to practice it/ hopefully remember it. Compound Operators (zybooks 2.6) I'll cover this in the while loop section, but not when it comes in the zybooks (unit 2)This is stuff like +=, -=, etc. It seems like another thing I could mention in class, but I'll already be overwhelming them with new stuff at that point.

Well not really, but here are a few things that I think need to be practiced a lot more than I can in class Basic Datatype methods (Methods on Strings, ints, floats, Sets, Lists, Dictionaries, Tuples) I think we should have a lab or assignment where students have to look up and use a bunch of string, int, and float methods. I think this would be good practice for them to get used to looking things up. Also, introducing a grid of them in a class doesn't really help them remember them.There are some basic things that will be included (indexing for example) but there are a bunch of string methods that they will only see in a grid of string methods, and they will forget about them unless they need to use them in practice. Floats vs Ints They will need practice on this. Just teaching them the difference isn't enough. They need to practice it. Lists and Modulo Modulo is useful for indexing lists so you don't index out of bounds. This would be good for an exercise Using the math and random modules I expose them to this in the first week, but then don't touch it for a while. It would be good to use them occasionally in exercises so they don't forget about them. Boolean Arithmetic I cover and, or, not and stuff, but in practice (especially for the problems they see which are introductory) they don't usually need them. We should either have the exercises require complex boolean arithmetic, or have them straight up write code that matches a boolean arithmetic expression or something. While loops All sorts of while loops with different step conditions. For loops Looping through Lists I will expose in class, but dictionaries, sets, tuples, strings, and other things will need to be practiced. Lists should also be heavily, if not the most heavily, practiced. Reinforce How Range works This is important to reinforce Comprehensions This is a really useful feature, please give them a lot of practice with this. They shouldn't just practice list comprehensions, they should practice dictionary and set comprehensions as well. But, probably not generator comprehensions since that's a weird can of worms. Enumerate and Zip I'll cover, but they are pretty useful (especially enumerate) so they should be practiced a lot. Nested Loops Needs practice before they can understand. Designing function signatures Students struggled with identifying what parameters a function should take in. They need practice with this.They should also use docstrings to document their functions so they can list the return type and parameter types.Or at least whatever this is called: (I think this is called a function signature, but the docstring is the documentation) def is_num_and_str(num: int, string: str) -&gt; bool: Expose them to function stubs (the above syntax) so they can write the function signature before they write the function body too.

However, I'm not sure about the value of exams. The purpose of an exam, from my understanding, is to verify how much each student understands about the topic. Students will have weekly assignments, and will have a lab every week. I think that the assignments and labs will be a better indicator of how much each student understands. Students who don't understand a concept will struggle with that week's exercises, challenges, and Lab. This lack of understanding will therefore be present in the grade. Additionally, most of the exam questions we had in the fall were very pinpointed. There were many questions on specific edge cases. This is what most CS exams end up with since a question needs to be specific to have a multiple choice answer. However, this also means that grades on the exam are very dependent on the student's ability to memorize edge cases. I don't think this is not a good indicator of how much the student understands the topic. On the other hand, having a lab I think is a better environment to evaluate this. In a lab, students write a program. This program is a good indicator of how much the student understands the topic. This is because the program is a direct result of the student's understanding of the topic. If the student doesn't understand the topic, they will struggle to write the program. If they do understand the topic, they will be able to write the program. A worry that could exist with this is that we are testing the group of 2-3 student's knowledge instead of an individual student. However, I think this is a good thing. In the real world, students will be working in groups. This is a good way to prepare them for that. Additionally, if we feel that the groups are inhibiting our ability to determine how much students understand, we can just make the lab sections that would have been exams, into labs without groups.

When writing code for a homework or project, the best practice is often to have all your files for that project in a single folder on your computer. That way, all your files are in one place for easy access, and we can just open the folder in VSCode to edit the code, rather than opening each file individually. To open a folder, select the file explorer icon in the top left. Then click &quot;Open Folder&quot;.  Alternatively, you can press ⌘+O on Mac (that is, press the command key and the &quot;O&quot; key at the same time, O for open), or Ctrl+K, Ctrl+O on Windows (just pressing Ctrl+O only lets you open single files, not folders). This will open your computer's file manager. In this window, you should navigate to either a.) an existing folder that either contains the code your want to edit, or is where you want to put new code, or b.) navigate to where you want to create a new folder. For example, let's say I want to make a new project. I want to open a folder called demo.

If not, click the Extension icon (Tetris blocks) on the left sidebar. Then enter &quot;Python&quot; in the search bar. The first result should be the Python extension, which you should install:  This extension gives you everything you need to start coding. It includes features like Syntax highlighting - colors your source code to make it easier to read what is a variable, what is a function, etc.A Python linter - a program that detects some errors, like typos, undeclared variables, or incorrect indentation, without you having to run the programA Python debugger - a powerful program that lets you step run your Python program line-by-line, and view the values of all your variables at any point in the execution.

"},{"title":"Grading Categories​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Syllabus","url":"/main/information/syllabus#grading-categories","content":"This course uses a standards-based grading system. Our goal is to shift focus from grades to learning. We will be using the following scale for all activities in this course: No AttemptBelow StandardsApproaching StandardsMeeting StandardsExceeding Standards What is standards-based grading? Why the shift from traditional grades? We believe that grades should communicate, as clearly as possible, what students know and can do. We also seek to create a growth mindset environment that encourages students to take risks and to embrace mistakes as learning opportunities. Standards-based grading and the corresponding five-point scale are set up to support these two values by clarifying learning goals and assessing students on their progress towards meeting those goals, rather than prioritizing completion of tasks and assignments over learning. This allows for more meaningful student learning and teacher feedback, and moves away from an approach in which students are seeking to earn points rather than practicing to meet the learning goal. What is the five-point scale? Educational researchers developed the five-point scale to more clearly assess what a student knows and can do: 4: Exceeding Standards, Consistently exceeds expectations for skills and understanding 3: Meeting Standards, Consistently meets expectations for skills and understanding2: Approaching Standards, Meets some expectations for skills and understanding1: Below Standards, Meets few expectations for skills and understanding0: No Submissions, Did not submit assignment What does this look like in practice? Students will receive assignment and final grades on the 0-4 scale. ​Students will receive 1-5 grades on assignments and for your semester grade; students will not receive letter grades (A, B, C, D) on assignments or fine-grained percentages. We will map our scale to letter grades for submission the the University at the end of the semester. Grades are clearer to students: ​Teachers and students engage in conversation about what 4/3/2/1/0 work looks like, so students understand what is expected and what they are learning. Grades are more useful and meaningful: ​When students get clear grades and feedback on a five point scale, they can monitor their progress and set goals for their learning. Teachers can also provide more specific feedback on how to improve from a “3” to a “4”.

If you submit an assignment before the deadline you will receive a token. You may then use a token to buy a late day allowing you to submit an assignment past the deadline. If you submit an assignment late and you run out of tokens, you may borrow tokens putting you in the negative. To get out of the hole you will need to submit subsequent assignments early to earn tokens back and pay your debt! If you complete the course with leftover tokens it will be applied to your final grade and increase your overall grade for the course. If you complete the course with negative tokens it will be applied to your final grade and decrease your overall grade for the course. Here are the rules: You start the course with 3 tokens.If you submit an assignment any day before or on the day an assignment is due you will receive a token.If you submit an assignment any day after the day an assignment is due you will pay a token for each day past the due date.You may only use tokens up to three days past the deadline of an assignment. After three days past the deadline you are no longer able to use tokens or submit an assignment late. It will be marked as missing with a 0.You can only hold a maximum of 5 tokens. That is, if you have 5 tokens and you hand an assignment early or on time, you still have 5 tokens.To use your tokens you must use our token request form available on the course LMS. What can tokens be used for? Tokens can be used on the following assessments: HomeworkLabs Examples: At the start of the semester Mia submits the first assignment two days early and receives a token increasing their purse to 4.In the middle of the semester Pat is late by 2 days. This uses 2 tokens from their purse. This is not bad since Pat hasn’t missed an assignment. Pat has 1 token remaining.At the end of the semester Jorge has 3 tokens and their grade is an 88. The tokens are applied and their final grade is a 91. Jorge is happy. 😃At the end of the semester Tanya has -2 tokens and their grade is a 90. The tokens are applied and their final grade is an 88. Tanya is unhappy 😔, but understands. You are ultimately responsible for maintaining your token count. We will do our best to calculate the number of tokens you have for each assignment.

Critical Thinking: Students will apply and demonstrate creative, analytical, quantitative, &amp; critical thinking through inquiry, problem solving, &amp; synthesis. Students will use critical thinking skills to solve problems from a computational perspective. As part of the problem-solving process students will use logical reasoning to create algorithms and data structures to develop programs that put their solutions into action. Furthermore, students will investigate aspects of performance and comparisons of equivalent algorithms to draw conclusions on efficiency. Lastly, students will explore and ask questions about real world problems and apply various forms of data analysis to answer these questions. Communication: Students will develop their writing skills through various assignments that require an articulation of their solution. They will also practice their oral communication by demonstrating their work (i.e., explaining an algorithm or technique) through a recorded video that will be part of assignment submissions. Connections: Students will connect the material in this course to real world problems such as using programming techniques to predict population size in the future and how that relates to pollution as well as many other issues that exist today. The goal of this course is to intentionally provide a connection between the concepts that are covered and how it impacts the world. This course is not only about learning how to program, it is about how to code to answer questions and to push forward and investigate how to construct solutions to solve problems.

In particular, it will advance student’s formal reasoning skills beyond the basic competency level by having them solve programming challenges on a weekly basis using a programming language. This will also increase a student’s sophistication as a consumer of numerical information as they must have a fundamental understanding of how a computer represents information (numerical or otherwise) in a discrete environment. Clearly, computer literacy is established in this context and naturally the limits of formal methods and the abuse of numerical arguments will be covered as part of developing programs and solving problems in general.

Group work will be a regular part of the course and students are expected to actively participate in it. Group work is allowed on all assignments in this course. You are allowed to submit an assignment as a group of up to 4 collaborators.Individual Submissions: Although group work is encouraged, each student is required to submit their own individual work based on the group collaboration. This is to ensure that each student is held accountable for their own learning and understanding of the course material.Group Responsibilities: All group members are expected to contribute equally to the group discussions and work and should be prepared to share their knowledge and skills with their peers. Group members should also be respectful of each other's opinions and work styles.Conflict Resolution: In the event of a conflict within the group, students are encouraged to communicate and resolve the issue amongst themselves. If the conflict cannot be resolved, the instructor will mediate.Credit Allocation: Credit for group work will be allocated based on each student's individual contribution to the assignment. Students will assess their own contributions to submitted assignments and determine their grades accordingly.Cheating: Cheating, including plagiarism, is not tolerated and will result in a failing grade for the assignment. All work submitted must be original and should accurately reflect the student's own understanding of the course material.Communication: Regular communication between group members is essential for successful collaboration. Students are encouraged to use online tools, such as email or group chat platforms, to stay in touch and communicate effectively. By following this collaboration policy, students will be able to work collectively while still being held accountable for their individual learning and understanding of the course material.

While these tools can be a valuable resource in your learning journey, it's essential to use them in a responsible and ethical manner. In this course, we allow the use of AI technologies like ChatGPT as a means of learning and improving your understanding of the subject matter. However, it's important to remember that the work you submit must be original and created by you, the student. Submitting work that is not your own constitutes academic dishonesty and is a violation of the code of conduct in this course. The use of AI technologies like ChatGPT should be seen as a tool for assistance, not a substitute for your own efforts. While it's tempting to rely solely on these tools to complete your assignments and projects, doing so will not help you develop the critical thinking and problem-solving skills that are essential for success in computer science. In conclusion, while we encourage the use of AI technologies like ChatGPT in your learning journey, it's important to use them responsibly and ethically. The work you submit must be original and created by you, and the use of these tools should be seen as a means of assistance, not a substitute for your own efforts. By doing so, you'll be able to make the most of these tools and develop the skills and knowledge you need to succeed in computer science.

Comments are lines that are ignored by the computer. You start a comment (in python) with the # character. Anything on that line after that character is ignored. So specifically, we want: # Author or # Authors to be the start of the first line of the file.# Email or # Emails to be the start of the second line of the file.# Spire ID or # Spire IDs to be the start of third line of the file.each of the above followed by the relevant information.

After the comments from earlier add the line print(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;)  print(), as you may have guessed, is a command that prints the input (to the terminal). The input is surrounded by parentheses. The quotes around the input, &quot;Hello, World!&quot;, indicate it is text (a string, more technically). Note: When showing code in general, we will use a mono-spaced font. When talking about &quot;commands&quot; like print(), we will have the () afterward to denote that it is a command. (Technically, these are called &quot;functions&quot;, but that lecture is next week.) Testing While we have autograded tests for you, we don't want to encourage dependence on the autograder. We want to try and impart testing and debugging skills so that you are equipped in any circumstance. To that end, we will have testing recommendations/suggestions where we can, so that you can test your code. In this case, running the code and making sure &quot;Hello, World!&quot; is printed is the natural thing to do. Running code and making sure it does what you expect is the essence of testing. (Finding out where it first deviates from what you expect is the essence of debugging) To run the code, open the built-in terminal (select Terminal &gt; New Terminal) and type in python3 hello.py in the terminal. You should now see: $ python3 hello.py Hello, World! This $ sign notation is not literal, it represents lines you entered input on. "},{"title":"4.

We will learn more about functions next week. But for some intuition: you can think of them as commands; you can think of them as ways to invoke re-usable, named snippets of code; or you can think of them as black boxes that take inputs (like functions in math), spit out outputs (like functions in math), and have side effect (un-like function in math). In this last view, print() takes in something to print, returns nothing, and has the side-effect of printing the input. &quot;Hello, World!&quot; is a &quot;string&quot;. We should have already learned about them (but in case not...). But for some intuition: there is a notion of numbers and text as different &quot;types&quot;, strings are the text-like type. To indicate something is text, we wrap it in quotation mark. Note: these are straight quotation marks. &quot;text&quot; will work, 'text' will also work; the following will not work: `text`, “text”, and ‘text’. No back-ticks, nothing that curls.
