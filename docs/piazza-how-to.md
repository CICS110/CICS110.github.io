# How to use Piazza

## Using Piazza
To ask a question, click the `New Post` button in the top left corner:

You'll then be presented with the following screen:

99% of the time you'll want to pick `Question`. Public posts are `Entire Class`, private posts are `Individual Student(s)/Instructor(s)`. If pick the latter, typing `Instructors` posts to the entire staff (this is preferred), but you can also post to just your instructor if you need to. 

Then select a folder based on what your question is about, type up your question, and press `Post My Note`.
## How to ask for Help
There are three main types of questions
1. Approach-based questions: How do I start Todo 4 in the project? 
2. Code-specific questions: Why is my code not working how I want it?
3. Logistical questions

Piazza is great for approach based questions. We highly recommend making these posts public so that other students can both see the questions, as well as discuss them or even answer them. You can always post anonymous!

For more on code-specific questions, see the [Posting Code](#posting-code) section.

For logistical questions, you can either post public or private, it's up to your discretion. You can even post directly to your instructor and no one else, but please reserve this for personal matters, not for content questions.
## Posting Code
A classic question that we see every semester is 
> Why is this not working? 

with an image of someone's source code attached. This is both an academic honesty violation, and is also usually hard for us to answer without just giving you the solution.

Firstly, **do not ever include your source code for an assignment in a public Piazza post.**
Posting your code to the entire class is code sharing, and is therefore an academic dishonesty violation per the academic honesty policy detailed in the syllabus.
We take this very seriously, so please do not do this.

Instead,
1. If you have a question about zyBooks or zyLabs, please make a public post direct us to the specific section and question. We can see your submissions, and will respond to your post with either general pointers, or even what you should look to change.

> Example: 
> I've stuck on the lab in section 2.15 of the lab. Can you give me some pointers?

2. If you have a question about an assignment, please first submit your current code to Gradescope. Then ask your question, and include a link to your Gradescope submission at the bottom.

> Example: 
> I am stuck on Todo 4, specifically the part with getting the print formatting right. Any advice? 
> 
> Gradescope link: `link to submission`

3. Lecture code and code in the homework exercises are fine to be posted, and we in fact encourage you as students to try to respond to these!
