# General Information

## Autograder Submission

The autograder is used to test your code more deeply. If you follow
the specifications of these exercises exactly then you should be able to
pass all of the tests the autograder is using to check your solution.

We use Gradescope to run our autograding software and record your
grade for these assignments. You may submit these assignments as many
times as possible up to the due date. If you encounter a problem with
the autograder you should contact the course staff immediately.

To run the autograder on your solutions, you must upload your `.py` files to
Gradescope.

## General Information and Project Policies

Read this entire document. If, after a careful reading, something
  seems ambiguous or unclear to you, then communicate to the course
  staff immediately. Start this assignment as soon as possible. Do not
  wait until the night before the assignment is due to tell us you
  donâ€™t understand something, as our ability to help you will be
  minimal.

The course staff are here to help you figure out errors, but not
  solve them for you. When you submit your solution, be sure to remove
  all compilation errors from your project. Any compilation errors in
  your project will cause the autograder to fail, and you will receive
  a zero for your submission. No Exceptions!

## Academic Honesty

All work that is completed in this assignment is your own. You may
talk to other students about the problems you are to solve, however,
you may not share code in any way, except with your partner. 
What you submit **must be your own work** (and that of your partner,
if applicable).

You may not use any code that is posted on the internet. If you are
not sure it is in your best interest to contact the course staff. We
will be using software that will compare your code to other students
in the course as well as online resources. It is very easy for us to
detect similar submissions and will result in a failure for the
exercise or possibly a failure for the course. Please, do not do
this. It is important to be academically honest and submit your work
only. Please review the [UMass Academic Honesty Policy and
Procedures](https://www.umass.edu/honesty/) so you are aware of what
this means.

Copying partial or whole solutions, obtained from other students or
elsewhere, is academic dishonesty. Do not share your code with your
classmates, and do not use your classmates' code. If you are confused
about what constitutes academic dishonesty you should re-read the
course policies.  We assume you have read the course policies in
detail and by submitting this project you have provided your virtual
signature in agreement with these policies.
