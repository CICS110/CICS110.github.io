# Changing Linter Colors
1. Open the VSCode Command Pallet: press Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows, or âŒ˜+Shift+P on MacOS.
2. Enter `Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)`
3. Scroll to the end of the file, and make a new line before the last `}`
4. Insert the following snippet on the newline:
```json
    "workbench.colorCustomizations": {
        "editorWarning.foreground": "#ffff00", // changes warning squiggle color
        "editorError.foreground": "#ff0000", // changes error squiggle color
        "editorInfo.foreground": "#3794ff" // changes information squiggle color
    }
```
5. Update the colors you would like to change

:::info 
The `#` followed by 6 characters is the "hex code" of a particular color. If you want to change the underline to a particular color, search that color's hex code, and replace the appropriate hex code. For example, to change the warning's color, I googled "yellow hex code", and put it in the warning line after the colon but before the comment.

6. Delete the lines of any colors you do not wish to change
For example, I just want change my warning color to yellow, and don't want to change the info and error line colors. Therefore, the last 7 lines of my `settings.json` looks like
```json title="settings.json"
    "git.confirmSync": false,
    "diffEditor.ignoreTrimWhitespace": false,
    "workbench.colorCustomizations": {
        "editorWarning.foreground": "#ffff00",
    }
}
```
