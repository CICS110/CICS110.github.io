# Guides

Welcome to the guides section of the course website! In this section, you will find a wealth of information and resources to help you get started and succeed in your course. Whether you are a beginner or have prior experience, our goal is to provide you with the support and guidance you need to succeed.

To get started, you will find guides for installing [Python](https://www.python.org) and setting up [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) (VSCode), two essential tools for programming. If you ever get stuck, our guide on "Getting Unstuck" will provide you with practical tips and strategies for overcoming common challenges. You will also find information on common errors and how to avoid them, as well as a guide on how to use Piazza, an online platform for connecting with your instructors and classmates and getting help with your coursework.

We are committed to helping you succeed in your computational thinking and computer programming course, and these guides are a key part of that support. Whether you are looking to install your first Python environment, troubleshoot an error, or get help with a course assignment, these guides are designed to provide you with the information and resources you need to achieve your goals. We hope you find them helpful and wish you the best of luck in your programming journey!
