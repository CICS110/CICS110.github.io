Gradescope allows us to provide fast and accurate feedback on your work. Before the deadline you can submit as many times as you need, so submit early and often to ensure you have something in before the deadline. Become familiar with Gradescope and verify that your submission has been properly uploaded before the deadline. Use OneDrive, DropBox, Google Drive, or some other backup software to ensure that your work is not lost in the event of a computer failure. The Gradescope autograder will provide you with some limited feedback on your submissions: does it compile, does it pass automated tests, what your score is, etc. The autograder does not provide detailed feedback. We will help you get familiar with Gradescope as the course progresses.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="vscode">VSCode<a class="hash-link" href="#vscode" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>We use the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VSCode</a> Development Environment for developing, debugging, and testing programming projects.

Our goal is to shift focus from grades to learning. We will be using the following scale for all activities in this course:</p><ol><li>No Attempt</li><li>Below Standards</li><li>Approaching Standards</li><li>Meeting Standards</li><li>Exceeding Standards</li></ol><p><strong>What is standards-based grading? Why the shift from traditional grades?</strong></p><p>We believe that grades should communicate, as clearly as possible, what students know and can do. We also seek to create a growth mindset environment that encourages students to take risks and to embrace mistakes as learning opportunities. Standards-based grading and the corresponding five-point scale are set up to support these two values by clarifying learning goals and assessing students on their progress towards meeting those goals, rather than prioritizing completion of tasks and assignments over learning. This allows for more meaningful student learning and teacher feedback, and moves away from an approach in which students are seeking to earn points rather than practicing to meet the learning goal.</p><p><strong>What is the five-point scale?</strong></p><p>Educational researchers developed the five-point scale to more clearly assess what a student knows and can do:</p><ul><li><strong>4:</strong> Exceeding Standards, Consistently exceeds expectations for skills and understanding </li><li><strong>3:</strong> Meeting Standards, Consistently meets expectations for skills and understanding</li><li><strong>2:</strong> Approaching Standards, Meets some expectations for skills and understanding</li><li><strong>1:</strong> Below Standards, Meets few expectations for skills and understanding</li><li><strong>0:</strong> No Submissions, Did not submit assignment</li></ul><p><strong>What does this look like in practice?</strong></p><p>Students will receive assignment and final grades on the 0-4 scale. ​Students will receive</p><p>1-5 grades on assignments and for your semester grade; students will not receive letter grades (A, B, C, D) on assignments or fine-grained percentages. We will map our scale to letter grades for submission the the University at the end of the semester.</p><p>Grades are clearer to students: ​Teachers and students engage in conversation about what 4/3/2/1/0 work looks like, so students understand what is expected and what they are learning.</p><p>Grades are more useful and meaningful: ​When students get clear grades and feedback on a five point scale, they can monitor their progress and set goals for their learning. Teachers can also provide more specific feedback on how to improve from a “3” to a “4”.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="grading-scale">Grading Scale<a class="hash-link" href="#grading-scale" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The following grade scale will be used for this course:</p><ul><li>A = 93-100%</li><li>A- = 90-92.99%</li><li>B+ = 87-89.99%</li><li>B = 83-86.99%</li><li>B- = 80-82.99%</li><li>C+ = 77-79.99%</li><li>C = 73-76.99%</li><li>C- = 70-72.99%</li><li>D+ = 67-69.99%</li><li>D = 60-66.99%</li><li>F = 0-59.99%</li></ul><p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>some adjustments may be made to the above grade scale to better reflect student performance.</em></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="participation">Participation<a class="hash-link" href="#participation" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>You will be assigned participation exercises to complete as part of the reading.

If you submit an assignment before the deadline you will receive a token. You may then use a token to buy a late day allowing you to submit an assignment past the deadline. If you submit an assignment late and you run out of tokens, you may borrow tokens putting you in the negative. To get out of the hole you will need to submit subsequent assignments early to earn tokens back and pay your debt!</p><p>If you complete the course with leftover tokens it will be applied to your final grade and increase your overall grade for the course.

In rare cases, extenuating circumstances may prevent a student from completing a course by that time. As part of the University Regulations, we may issue an Incomplete (INC) for a course, rather than a course grade, if a student submits a request to the instructor(s). The criteria for granting an INC request are determined by the course instructors. The following is an excerpt from <a href="https://cutt.ly/jm8K1em" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Section VI D in the Academic Regulations</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“Students who are unable to complete course requirements within the allotted time because of severe medical or personal problems may request a grade of Incomplete from the instructor of the course. Normally, incomplete grades are warranted only if a student is passing the course at the time of the request and if the course requirements can be completed by the end of the following semester. Instructors who turn in a grade of &quot;INC&quot; are required to leave a written record of the following information with the departmental office of the academic department under which the course is offered: (1) the percentage of work completed, (2) the grade earned by the student on the completed work, (3) a description of the work that remains to be completed, (4) a description of the method by which the student is to complete the unfinished work, and (5) the date by which the work is to be completed. In the case of an independent study where the entire grade is determined by one paper or project, the instructor should leave with the department information pertaining to the paper or project, which will complete the course. To avoid subsequent misunderstanding, it is recommended that the student also be provided with a copy of this information.”</p></blockquote><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="criteria">Criteria<a class="hash-link" href="#criteria" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The incomplete criterion for this course requires that you have:</p><ul><li>At least 60% of the course must be completed with a passing grade.</li><li>A valid reason for requesting an INC that relates to a severe medical or personal problem</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="requests">Requests<a class="hash-link" href="#requests" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Towards the end of the semester a notification will be posted about incomplete requests.

INFO 190S satisfies the following General Education objectives:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Content:</strong> Students will know fundamental questions, ideas, and methods of analysis in computing. In particular, students will learn how to problem solve using a modern programming language, apply programming and problem solving to real world problems.</p></li><li><p><strong>Critical Thinking:</strong> Students will apply and demonstrate creative, analytical, quantitative, &amp; critical thinking through inquiry, problem solving, &amp; synthesis. Students will use critical thinking skills to solve problems from a computational perspective. As part of the problem-solving process students will use logical reasoning to create algorithms and data structures to develop programs that put their solutions into action. Furthermore, students will investigate aspects of performance and comparisons of equivalent algorithms to draw conclusions on efficiency. Lastly, students will explore and ask questions about real world problems and apply various forms of data analysis to answer these questions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Communication:</strong> Students will develop their writing skills through various assignments that require an articulation of their solution. They will also practice their oral communication by demonstrating their work (i.e., explaining an algorithm or technique) through a recorded video that will be part of assignment submissions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Connections:</strong> Students will connect the material in this course to real world problems such as using programming techniques to predict population size in the future and how that relates to pollution as well as many other issues that exist today. The goal of this course is to intentionally provide a connection between the concepts that are covered and how it impacts the world.
