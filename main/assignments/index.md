# Assignments

Welcome to the assignments section of the course website! Here, you will find all the information and resources you need to succeed in the hands-on component of your course. Our assignments are designed to give you the opportunity to practice the concepts and skills you have learned in lecture, helping you to solidify your understanding and become a proficient programmer.

The assignments consist of questions and programming exercises that will challenge you to apply what you have learned in lecture to real-world problems. Practicing your understanding of concepts and programming skills is essential to becoming a proficient computational thinker and programmer, just as practicing a musical instrument is essential to becoming a proficient musician. The more you practice, the better you will become.

Our goal is to provide you with a comprehensive and engaging learning experience that will help you achieve your goals as a computational thinker and programmer. These assignments are an essential part of that experience, giving you the opportunity to practice what you have learned in lecture and solidify your understanding of the course material. Whether you are a beginner or have prior experience, we are confident that you will find our homework assignments to be a valuable tool in your programming journey. Good luck and happy coding!
