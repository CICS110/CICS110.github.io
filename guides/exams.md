# Guide to Exams
This is a guide of how to be prepared for exams as a student in CICS 110.

## Overview
In-class exams will be held during the lab session. Lab attendance is required to complete the exam. All exams are hosted on Moonami/Moodle, and you will need a laptop to take the exam.

Midterm exams are 50 minutes long, but you are allowed to leave once you are finished. It is your responsibility to ensure your device is working when the exam starts, you don't want to spend the first 10 minutes connecting to the internet! 
## Requirements
To take the exam, you must attend the lab session you are enrolled in.
If you cannot make the lab time you have enrolled in, it is your responsibility to reach out to your Instructor at least a week ahead of time to make accommodations. 

It is your responsibility to
1. Bring your own laptop and uCard.
2. Ensure your laptop is charged when you arrive at the exam. If you laptop does not hold a charge, you are responsible for bringing a charger, but we cannot guarantee you will be able to sit near a functioning outlet. 
3. Ensure your laptop is connects to Eduroam, and gets a connection in lab room.

If you do not own a laptop, your laptop is not working, or your laptop is out for repairs:
- Borrow a friends laptop for the lab period.
- Use the library's laptop borrowing program. There are a limited number of laptops, but we rarely see them run out. Go to the Learning Commons Desk in the lower level of the W.E.B. Du Bois Library to check on their availability. Laptops are 3 day loans for free. There is a $10/day late return fee up to $50.
- Use another internet connected device. A phone is not advisable, but a tablet should suffice.

## Preparing for the Exam
One week prior to every exam, an announcement will be made detailing
- Exam Coverage: the zyBook chapters and lectures that the exam questions test
- Exam Structure: the types of questions you can expect, maybe with an estimate of how many of each

You will be able to freely navigate between the questions during the exam.

The Supplemental Instructor (SI) for the course will usually host an exam review session the week of the exam.
They will have not seen the exam, but are prepared to help you study for the exam.

## Taking the Exam
Before you start the exam, we ask that you close all other tabs and windows. This includes, but is not limited to
- VSCode/other editors
- zyBooks
- Piazza
- Online resources

Once you have completed the exam, you will be asked to show course staff your uCard. Staff will make sure you have submitted your exam, and check you out. 
## Academic Honesty
During the exam, the expectation is that you do not leave the exam window. You should not need to tab out during the exam. Use of your laptop or a secondary device during the exam to view
- textbook
- labs
- online materials
- instant messages or email

are all academic honesty violations, and may lead to you getting a zero on the exam or in the course. 

**Do not do it.** It is not worth it.
