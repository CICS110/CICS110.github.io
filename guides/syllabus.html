solving using computers. This course teaches you how real-world problems can be solved computationally using programming constructs and data abstractions of a modern programming language. Concepts and techniques covered include variables, expressions, data types, objects, branching, iteration, functions, classes, and methods. We will also cover how to translate problems into a sequence of instructions, investigate the fundamental operation of a computational system and trace program execution and memory, and learn how to test and debug programs. No previous programming experience required.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="statement-of-inclusivity">Statement of Inclusivity<a class="hash-link" href="#statement-of-inclusivity" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The staff for this course support the UMass commitment to diversity, and welcome individuals regardless of age, background, citizenship, disability, sex, education, ethnicity, family status, gender, gender identity, geographical origin, language, military experience, political views, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and work experience.

Gradescope allows us to provide fast and accurate feedback on your work. Before the deadline you can submit as many times as you need, so submit early and often to ensure you have something in before the deadline. Become familiar with Gradescope and verify that your submission has been properly uploaded before the deadline. Use OneDrive, DropBox, Google Drive, or some other backup software to ensure that your work is not lost in the event of a computer failure. The Gradescope autograder will provide you with some limited feedback on your submissions: does it compile, does it pass automated tests, what your score is, etc. The autograder does not provide detailed feedback. We will help you get familiar with Gradescope as the course progresses.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="vscode">VSCode<a class="hash-link" href="#vscode" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>We use the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VSCode</a> Development Environment for developing, debugging, and testing programming projects. This is free software and you will be given installation instructions and training in its use. There are many excellent Python integrated development environments (IDE), editors, and tools that exist, however, we recommend VSCode as it is easy to learn, and we will be using it in class for code demonstrations. You can read more about VSCode <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> and we encourage you to try out the “Getting Started with Python in VSCode” as preparation for the class.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="python">Python<a class="hash-link" href="#python" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>We will be using the <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Python programming language</a> in this course. It is an excellent language to learn about programming and computational thinking. It is also used extensively in the software engineering, data science domain, and many additional areas of computing. You will be required to download and install Python on your own computer. You will be using Python and VSCode to complete many programming tasks as part of your studies in this class. The current Python version used in this course is 3.10.6.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="communication">Communication<a class="hash-link" href="#communication" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="email">Email<a class="hash-link" href="#email" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Email should not be used. <strong>Please post privately to Instructors on Piazza.</strong></p><p>In the unlikely event that you are unable to post to Piazza, please send an email to the instructor teaching your course section.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="piazza">Piazza<a class="hash-link" href="#piazza" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>We will be using Piazza for all other communication.

As a rough guide, expect to require at least a 93 to get an A, a 90 to get an A-, an 87 to get a B+, an 83 to get a B, an 80 to get a B-, etc.</p><p>Individual grade items are not curved, so you should not get stressed about means, standard deviations, etc. related to scores you receive. What matters is your weighted average; we do not give favorable (or unfair) treatment by raising or lowering individual students’ letter grades.</p><p><strong>There are no opportunities for extra credit in this course; please do not ask.</strong></p><p>You are responsible for monitoring your grades. Grades will be available through Moodle and you should check them regularly and review any provided feedback. If you encounter any issues with your grades, you will have one week past the first posting of a particular assignment’s grade to Moodle to contact the course staff so that we can investigate.</p><p>The following grade scale will be used for this course:</p><ul><li>A = 93-100%</li><li>A- = 90-92.99%</li><li>B+ = 87-89.99%</li><li>B = 83-86.99%</li><li>B- = 80-82.99%</li><li>C+ = 77-79.99%</li><li>C = 73-76.99%</li><li>C- = 70-72.99%</li><li>D+ = 67-69.99%</li><li>D = 60-66.99%</li><li>F = 0-59.99%</li></ul><p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>some adjustments may be made to the above grade scale to better reflect student performance.</em></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lab-assignments">Lab Assignments<a class="hash-link" href="#lab-assignments" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Most labs will be accompanied by an assignment that you will complete totally or partially during your assigned lab section. You will complete 1 to 3 programming exercises during the lab. If you are unable to complete the assignment during that time you will be responsible for completing the work on your own time before the assigned due date. You may work collaboratively during the lab section, but submit your work individually. Labs will be assigned at the start of the lab in Moodle and completed and submitted in the zyBook. They will be automatically graded by the zyLab autograding system. During the lab section you will have the opportunity to ask the lab staff questions. The lab staff will provide guidance so that you may complete the lab successfully. Lab assignments are low-stakes exercises that are designed to allow you to practice your understanding of the material covered in the book and during lecture in the presence of the course staff in a collaborative setting. You will need to bring a laptop if you have one or work with another student. If you do not have a laptop, please notify the course staff so we can make arrangements for you to work with another student.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="homework-assignments">Homework Assignments<a class="hash-link" href="#homework-assignments" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>There will be a number of homework assignments that you will complete individually by the assigned due date. Each homework assignment will have you complete a programming challenge by analyzing the problem, coding the solution, answering some questions about the problem, and providing a reflection on your experience before you hand in your solution. Homework assignments will be completed using Zylab and/or VSCode and your completed assignment will be submitted to Zylabs or Gradescope. Homework assignments are a low-stakes exercise that are designed for you to practice problem solving with code independently.</p><p>As you complete a homework assignment you should take note of your abilities with respect to the material. Although getting the correct code is an important part of programming, that is not the only criteria you are evaluated on and it is not necessarily the purpose of a homework assignment. You should use the homework as an instrument to determine how well you are understanding the material.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="programming-projects">Programming Projects<a class="hash-link" href="#programming-projects" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>There will be approximately 4 programming projects. Programming projects are high-stakes programming assignments that will assess you on what you have learned. A programming project is a more in-depth assignment where you will apply the programming concepts you have learned to solving a problem. You will need to demonstrate your understanding of the concepts and the programming skills you have learned from the zyBook, lecture, lab, and homework. Programming projects are completed independently using Python/VSCode and are automatically graded by Gradescope. Gradescope will run several tests on your program to evaluate your solution. You will be allowed to submit a programming project as many times as you would like before the deadline. Programming projects measure your mastery of the learning outcomes.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="exams">Exams<a class="hash-link" href="#exams" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>There will be 3 in-class exams. Your best two scores will count towards your final grade. Exams are high-stakes assignments that will assess your ability to recall, understand, and apply the course material covered in the zyBook, lecture, lab, homework, and programming projects. Each exam focuses on specific lectures and associated material and assignments. Due to the nature of the material, all exams are cumulative. </p><p>Exams will be taken during a scheduled class session. You will have the entire class period to complete the exam and submit it. Questions consist of multiple choice, true/false, fill in the blank, matching, reading/writing code and other similar forms.</p><p>To prepare for an exam you should review all the readings, lecture material, code, and exercises/assignments covered by the exam. It is important that you plan ahead and give yourself plenty of time to review the material. Cramming for an exam or pulling an all nighter can lead to anxiety and exhaustion and often result in lower performance. So, be kind to yourself and begin preparations by studying the material often and early.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="final-exam">Final Exam<a class="hash-link" href="#final-exam" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The final exam will be given during the final exam period.

In rare cases, extenuating circumstances may prevent a student from completing a course by that time. As part of the University Regulations, we may issue an Incomplete (INC) for a course, rather than a course grade, if a student submits a request to the instructor(s). The criteria for granting an INC request are determined by the course instructors. The following is an excerpt from <a href="https://cutt.ly/jm8K1em" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Section VI D in the Academic Regulations</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“Students who are unable to complete course requirements within the allotted time because of severe medical or personal problems may request a grade of Incomplete from the instructor of the course. Normally, incomplete grades are warranted only if a student is passing the course at the time of the request and if the course requirements can be completed by the end of the following semester. Instructors who turn in a grade of &quot;INC&quot; are required to leave a written record of the following information with the departmental office of the academic department under which the course is offered: (1) the percentage of work completed, (2) the grade earned by the student on the completed work, (3) a description of the work that remains to be completed, (4) a description of the method by which the student is to complete the unfinished work, and (5) the date by which the work is to be completed. In the case of an independent study where the entire grade is determined by one paper or project, the instructor should leave with the department information pertaining to the paper or project, which will complete the course. To avoid subsequent misunderstanding, it is recommended that the student also be provided with a copy of this information.”</p></blockquote><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="criteria">Criteria<a class="hash-link" href="#criteria" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The incomplete criterion for this course requires that you have:</p><ul><li>At least 60% of the course must be completed with a passing grade.</li><li>A valid reason for requesting an INC that relates to a severe medical or personal problem</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="requests">Requests<a class="hash-link" href="#requests" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Towards the end of the semester a notification will be posted about incomplete requests.

The General Education Program at the University of Massachusetts Amherst offers students a unique opportunity to develop critical thinking, communication, and learning skills that will benefit them for a lifetime. For more information about the General Education Program, please visit the <a href="https://www.umass.edu/gened" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GenEd webpage</a>.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="general-education-learning-outcomes">General Education Learning Outcomes<a class="hash-link" href="#general-education-learning-outcomes" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The General Education Program has four common objectives that pervade all designations. INFO 190S satisfies the following General Education objectives:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Content:</strong> Students will know fundamental questions, ideas, and methods of analysis in computing. In particular, students will learn how to problem solve using a modern programming language, apply programming and problem solving to real world problems.</p></li><li><p><strong>Critical Thinking:</strong> Students will apply and demonstrate creative, analytical, quantitative, &amp; critical thinking through inquiry, problem solving, &amp; synthesis. Students will use critical thinking skills to solve problems from a computational perspective. As part of the problem-solving process students will use logical reasoning to create algorithms and data structures to develop programs that put their solutions into action. Furthermore, students will investigate aspects of performance and comparisons of equivalent algorithms to draw conclusions on efficiency. Lastly, students will explore and ask questions about real world problems and apply various forms of data analysis to answer these questions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Communication:</strong> Students will develop their writing skills through various assignments that require an articulation of their solution. They will also practice their oral communication by demonstrating their work (i.e., explaining an algorithm or technique) through a recorded video that will be part of assignment submissions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Connections:</strong> Students will connect the material in this course to real world problems such as using programming techniques to predict population size in the future and how that relates to pollution as well as many other issues that exist today. The goal of this course is to intentionally provide a connection between the concepts that are covered and how it impacts the world. This course is not only about learning how to program, it is about how to code to answer questions and to push forward and investigate how to construct solutions to solve problems.</p></li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="r2-learning-outcomes">R2 Learning Outcomes<a class="hash-link" href="#r2-learning-outcomes" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>This course will satisfy the R2 learning outcomes. In particular, it will advance student’s formal reasoning skills beyond the basic competency level by having them solve programming challenges on a weekly basis using a programming language. This will also increase a student’s sophistication as a consumer of numerical information as they must have a fundamental understanding of how a computer represents information (numerical or otherwise) in a discrete environment. Clearly, computer literacy is established in this context and naturally the limits of formal methods and the abuse of numerical arguments will be covered as part of developing programs and solving problems in general.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="schedule">Schedule<a class="hash-link" href="#schedule" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The following is a schedule of topics and assignments for this course.
