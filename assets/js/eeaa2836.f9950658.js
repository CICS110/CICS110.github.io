A function for generating a solution that randomly selects a 5-letter word. We will create a list of 5-letter words by searching on the Web. We will use python\u2019s built-in module random to randomly select one of these words from the list.\n2. A function for getting user input that asks the user to enter a 5-letter guess. We will use the input function and a try/except to make sure their input is valid. If the input is invalid, the user will need to enter another guess, so we will also use a loop here.\n3. A function for printing a guess back to the user. Printing involves turning all letters to capitalization and adding a space between each letter for better readability.\n4. A function for comparing a guess to the solution. The function should compare the two words letter-by-letter. This will require a loop. Branching will be used in the loop to determine what symbol to print based on if the letters are correct or incorrect (green = correct, red = incorrect).\n5. A function that calls all of the above functions, imitating one turn of the game. \n6. A function that calls the one turn function up to 6 times (because there are 6 attempts allowed). The function will additionally check if the game should be over (i.e., if a player won).\n\nGroup Member Roles:\nAllison will work on functions for generating a solution, getting user input, and printing a guess back to the user\nTim will work on a function for comparing a guess to a solution\nWe will then work together to create a function for one turn, and a function for calling one turn up to 6 times\n")),(0,a.kt)("h4",{id:"project-plan-grading-scale"},"Project Plan Grading Scale"),(0,a.kt)("p",null,(0,a.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"1: Below Standards:")," Project Plan is incomplete and mentions very few requirements\n",(0,a.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"2: Approaching Standards:")," Project Plan mentions at least ",(0,a.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"25%")," of the requirements\n",(0,a.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"3: Meeting Standards:")," Project Plan mentions at least ",(0,a.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"50%")," of the requirements and ",(0,a.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"includes at least one decision tree diagram"),"\n",(0,a.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"4: Exceeding Standards:")," Project Plan mentions at least ",(0,a.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"80%")," of the requirements and ",(0,a.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"includes at least one decision tree diagram")),(0,a.kt)("h3",{id:"step-3-implement-a-solution-using-python"},"Step 3.
